                <p class="font-medium">
                    Ans:- <span class="text-cyan-500" >DOM</span> is a programming <span class="text-cyan-500" >API</span> for Document Object Model in JavaScript. A web page is a document that can be displayed in a browser window or as <span class="text-cyan-500" > HTML</span> source. <br> In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model <span class="text-cyan-500" >(DOM)</span> representation allows it to be manipulated. <br> As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                <p class="font-bold"> Q. No3.  What is event bubble?</p>
                <p>
                    Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.

                <p class="font-bold"> Q. No4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function
